I am an experienced software engineer who has developed applications at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the hypergrowth unicorn [Rippling](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rippling). I am skilled in operating across a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Java, Ruby, Python, AWS, Docker, and more. I have a passion for taking on challenging projects, and I am especially adept at driving operational excellence. As a valuable asset to any team, I am excited to bring my experience to any new software project.
