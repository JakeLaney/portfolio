Ever since picking up my first C programming book in high school, I have been on a continuous journey of growth as a software engineer. With a strong background in distributed systems, software as a service (SAAS), and product development, I possess a versatile skill set that spans from infrastructure to frontend development, enabling me to contribute across multiple layers of the software stack. Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered solutions at renowned companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and [Rippling](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rippling), consistently demonstrating my expertise across the entire software life cycle, from design to implementation and operations.
